# üí´ About Me:
<br>Graduated in psychology, I was certified by Unity and Adobe a few years ago, I am a game (Unity) and application developer, always keeping an eye on code architecture patterns.  I have almost 10 years as a developer and 6 years of international experience in the area, as well as the ability to remain calm in stressful situations.  I recently worked successfully with communication, leadership and team management thanks to my knowledge in psychology, but I currently work as an Android developer.

 What is most rewarding for me is having the opportunity to help people immerse themselves in the area through a social project that I have with some friends.
